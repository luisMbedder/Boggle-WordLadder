* Project : Boggle

*
* Description : Implements the game of Boggle adapted for a human player
* against the computer. The heart of the program consists of two recursive
* backtracking algorithms to find words on the board, one for the human player
* and another for the computer. The computer proves nearly impossible
* to beat since it has a lexicon at its disposal!
*
* Notes : None.
